Integration 

What is DHIS2 system integration?
●	The process of connecting DHIS2 with other software systems to exchange information and functionality
●	The process of designing a health information system
●	The process of creating a complex information system
●	The process of building custom software

When is it beneficial to use an automated integration? (select all that apply)
●	If the metadata are constantly changing
●	If the metadata are stable/not changing 
●	If the process needs to be done on a regular basis
●	If there are mass amounts of data

What is the role of Identifier Schemes in integration?
●	They define the communication style between client and server
●	They link various metadata objects when importing data
●	They facilitate data transfers between different servers
●	They provide authentication for API requests

What is a reason for performing cross program integration within one DHIS2 instance?
●	To limit access to specific programs
●	To separate data from different programs
●	Due to limited cross program analytics
●	To prevent integration with external systems
